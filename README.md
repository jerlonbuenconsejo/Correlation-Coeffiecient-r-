# Correlation-Coeffiecient-r-

This is my personal approach that will calculate the correlation coefficient of x,y pairs as part of my study in Statistics for Data Science. 

How to interpret: 
r calculation produces a number.
The lowest possible number is -1.0 (perfect negative correlation).
The highest possible number is 1.0 (perfect positive correlation)
